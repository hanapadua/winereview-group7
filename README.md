## Winery Data
For this project the team was tasked with generating a mongoDB collection derived from two csv data sets and a json data set. The data itself is made up of various wine reviews from around the world containing the wine price, region, the winery and other pertinent data for a wine review. The team took the appropriate steps to make the data presentable and easy to query as requested. 

## Wine Data File Manipulation
*Steps taken to clean Data:*
  
  -Eroneous Columns Removed
  
  -CSV Converted to JSON
  
  -Merge CSVs
  
  -Delete duplicate entries
