## Winery Data
For this project the team was tasked with generating a mongoDB collection derived from two csv data sets and a json data set. The data itself is made up of various wine reviews from around the world containing the wine price, region, the winery and other pertinent data for a wine review. The team took the appropriate steps to make the data presentable and easy to query as requested.
